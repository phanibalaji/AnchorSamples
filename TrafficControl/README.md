This sample illustrates the traffic control mechanism in Istio

1. Deploy the upstream node service using the below command.
```
kubectl apply -f upstreamNode.yaml
```
It deploys the two versions of the Nodejs service version 1 & version 2. 
Creates a virtual service which route 25% traffic to V1 and 75% to V2.

2. Deploy the downstream GO service which call the upstream nodejs service.
```
kubectl apply -f downstreamGo.yaml
```

3. Call the downstream GO service as below
```
phanim-macbookpro:TrafficControl phanim$ kubectl exec -it sleep-79cc87b6b9-cxh6q -- curl http://downstreamgo:8080/downstreamGo && echo ""

Defaulting container name to sleep.
Use 'kubectl describe pod/sleep-79cc87b6b9-cxh6q -n default' to see all of the containers in this pod.
{"Message":"Hello from Upstream Nodejs service","version":"1","Time":"2018-12-20T11:55:33.632Z","IP":"10.16.2.14"}

phanim-macbookpro:TrafficControl phanim$ kubectl exec -it sleep-79cc87b6b9-cxh6q -- curl http://downstreamgo:8080/downstreamGo && echo ""

Defaulting container name to sleep.
Use 'kubectl describe pod/sleep-79cc87b6b9-cxh6q -n default' to see all of the containers in this pod.
{"Message":"Hello from Upstream Nodejs service","version":"2","Time":"2018-12-20T11:55:36.600Z","IP":"10.16.1.12"}
```
Closely 25% traffic will go to V1 and 75% will go to V2 if we continuously make calls to the service
